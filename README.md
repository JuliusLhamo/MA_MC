**Multiaccuracy/Multicalibration**

This project is a use case of two different datasets - the Beauty Dataset and the Adult Dataset - to explore the fairness notions of multi-calibration and multi-accuracy in machine learning using the mlr3 and mcboost R packages.

The Beauty Dataset contains information about beauty products, including ratings and reviews, while the Adult Dataset contains census data on individuals, including their income levels. The project aims to evaluate the fairness of machine learning models trained on these datasets, with a focus on multi-calibration and multi-accuracy.

The mlr3 package is used for machine learning in R, providing a unified interface to various machine learning algorithms. The mcboost package is used for gradient boosting, a popular machine learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks.

The project involves the application of machine learning algorithms using mlr3 and mcboost to the datasets, followed by an evaluation of the models using metrics such as calibration plots and accuracy scores. The results of the evaluation are then analyzed to assess the fairness of the models, with a focus on multi-calibration and multi-accuracy.

In conclusion, this project provides a practical demonstration of the fairness notions of multi-calibration and multi-accuracy in machine learning using the mlr3 and mcboost packages. The project highlights the importance of evaluating machine learning models for fairness, and provides insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with developing fair machine learning models using these packages.
